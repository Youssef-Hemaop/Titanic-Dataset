# **🛳 Titanic Dataset Analysis**

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the famous Titanic dataset, exploring survival patterns and applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data handling and analytical skills in Python.

## **📂 Project Structure**

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

**1️⃣ Data Exploration**

What was done:

Loaded the Titanic dataset from Data Science Dojo’s GitHub repository
.

Explored the dataset’s shape, data types, and sample records using .info(), .shape, .sample(), and .describe().

Examined categorical features (Pclass, Sex, Embarked) with .nunique(), .unique(), and .value_counts().

Why it matters:
This step builds familiarity with the dataset. Understanding the structure and distribution of features is essential before cleaning and analysis.

**2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

What was done:

Checked for missing values using .isnull().sum().

Calculated missing percentages.

Imputed missing Age values with the median.

Addressed missing values in Fare and Embarked.

Why it matters:
Machine learning models and statistical analysis require complete data. Cleaning ensures that the dataset is consistent, reliable, and ready for feature extraction.

**3️⃣ Feature Engineering**

What was done:

Created new columns such as FamilySize (combining SibSp + Parch).

Introduced binary features like IsAlone.

Transformed categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numerical encodings.

Why it matters:
Well-designed features help models capture important survival patterns (e.g., people traveling alone vs. with family). Feature engineering often makes a bigger difference than complex models.

**4️⃣ Deep Exploratory Analysis**

What was done:

Visualized distributions of key variables (Age, Fare, Pclass) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Compared survival rates across groups (e.g., gender, class, family size).

Analyzed correlations between features and survival outcomes.

Why it matters:
Visualization uncovers hidden relationships and trends that raw statistics might miss. For example, women and children had higher survival rates, while third-class passengers were less likely to survive.

**5️⃣ NumPy Applications**

What was done:

Applied NumPy arrays for numerical transformations and efficient calculations.

Standardized numerical features like Age and Fare using vectorized operations.

Computed outliers and scaling with NumPy functions.

Why it matters:
NumPy provides fast, memory-efficient numerical operations, which are essential for handling larger datasets and preparing inputs for machine learning models.

## **🛠 Tools & Libraries**

Python 🐍

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical processing

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

**🚀 Next Steps**

This notebook forms the foundation for:

Building predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Applying advanced feature selection

Experimenting with machine learning pipelines for survival prediction

**👉 This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis: from cleaning and exploring raw data to engineering meaningful features and analyzing survival patterns.**
