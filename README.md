# **üõ≥ Titanic Dataset Analysis**

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the famous Titanic dataset, exploring survival patterns and applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data handling and analytical skills in Python.

## **üìÇ Project Structure**

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration**

What was done:

Loaded the Titanic dataset from Data Science Dojo‚Äôs GitHub repository
.

Explored the dataset‚Äôs shape, data types, and sample records using .info(), .shape, .sample(), and .describe().

Examined categorical features (Pclass, Sex, Embarked) with .nunique(), .unique(), and .value_counts().

Why it matters:
This step builds familiarity with the dataset. Understanding the structure and distribution of features is essential before cleaning and analysis.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

What was done:

Checked for missing values using .isnull().sum().

Calculated missing percentages.

Imputed missing Age values with the median.

Addressed missing values in Fare and Embarked.

Why it matters:
Machine learning models and statistical analysis require complete data. Cleaning ensures that the dataset is consistent, reliable, and ready for feature extraction.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering**

What was done:

Created new columns such as FamilySize (combining SibSp + Parch).

Introduced binary features like IsAlone.

Transformed categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numerical encodings.

Why it matters:
Well-designed features help models capture important survival patterns (e.g., people traveling alone vs. with family). Feature engineering often makes a bigger difference than complex models.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning**

What was done:

Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables such as Sex and Embarked to prepare the data for machine learning models.
Implemented basic model experiments (e.g., Logistic Regression and Decision Trees) to predict survival outcomes based on engineered features.

Why it matters:
Encoding categorical variables ensures that algorithms can interpret non-numeric data. Even simple models can reveal feature importance and highlight the impact of preprocessing on predictive performance.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ NumPy Applications**

What was done:

Applied NumPy arrays for numerical transformations and efficient calculations.

Standardized numerical features like Age and Fare using vectorized operations.

Computed outliers and scaling with NumPy functions.

Why it matters:
NumPy provides fast, memory-efficient numerical operations, which are essential for handling larger datasets and preparing inputs for machine learning models.

## **üõ† Tools & Libraries**

Python üêç

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical processing

**üöÄ Next Steps**

This notebook forms the foundation for:

Building predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Applying advanced feature selection

Experimenting with machine learning pipelines for survival prediction

**üëâ This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis: from cleaning and exploring raw data to engineering meaningful features and analyzing survival patterns.**
